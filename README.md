🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – Power BI

This Power BI project presents a comprehensive Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard, created using real-world hospital data stored in a CSV format. The dashboard provides detailed visual insights into patient flow, wait times, admission rates, and departmental referrals across various months in 2023 and 2024.

📁 Data Source: The data was imported from a CSV sheet containing hospital ER visit records from Jan 2023 to Aug 2024. Preprocessing and data modeling were done within Power BI, ensuring clean relationships and optimized visual performance.

📊 Dashboard Highlights 📆 Monthly & Consolidated Views Analyze patient data month-by-month or as a year-to-date summary. Monitor trends and compare ER metrics over time.

🛏️ Admission Status Breakdown View the proportion of admitted vs. non-admitted patients with monthly and overall percentages.

⏱ Average Wait Time & Satisfaction Scores See how long patients waited on average and how satisfied they were — key indicators of ER service quality.

🏥 Departmental Referrals Understand which departments patients were referred to most — from General Practice to Neurology and beyond.

👥 Demographic Analysis Patients grouped by age, gender, and city Heatmaps of visits by hour of day and day of week

🎯 Performance Metrics Tracks what percentage of patients were seen within the 30-minute benchmark, highlighting service bottlenecks.

📋 Detailed Patient View A granular view listing patient IDs, names, gender, age, department referral, admission status, wait time, and satisfaction score.

📌 Tools & Technologies: Microsoft Power BI Desktop CSV data source DAX for calculated columns and measures Slicers and filters for interactivity

🎓 Knowledge Gained: This project helped deepen my understanding of the following concepts: ✅ Power BI Fundamentals: importing and cleaning data from CSV files, building data models, and creating relationships. ✅ Data Modeling: learning how to structure and relate multiple visuals using filters and slicers for seamless interaction. ✅ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): used for creating calculated columns and measures (e.g., average wait time, percentage calculations). ✅ Data Visualization Best Practices: choosing the right charts and visuals (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, heat maps) for meaningful interpretation. ✅ Real-World Healthcare Insights: learned how ERs operate in terms of patient flow, admission patterns, peak hours, and service quality measurement. ✅ Problem Solving: handled missing values, improved dashboard performance, and designed a clean, readable layout.
